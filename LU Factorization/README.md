This algorithm takes an input of a square matrix and performs LU decomposition on that matrix and outputs the upper tringular matrix (U),
the lower triangular matrix (L), and the pivot matrix (P)

Inputs:

• A (A square matrix)

Outputs:

• U (Upper triangular matrix)
• L (Lower triangular matrix)
• P (Pivot matrix)

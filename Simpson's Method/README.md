This function takes an input of two vectors that are equal in length and evenly spaced and returns an output that is the numerical integral of function 
values "y" with respect to "x" over the interval described by the two vectors. 

Inputs:

• x (An evenly spaced vector describing the points of the independant variable that you are integrating with respect to)

• y (The dependant variable values that result from the x values)

Outputs:

• I (The integral over the input interval)
